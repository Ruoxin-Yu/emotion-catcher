🎮 Emotion Catcher

**Emotion Catcher** is an interactive web mini-game about rhythm, attention, and emotional control.  
You move a basket to **catch emotions** that fall from above — collecting the good ones, avoiding the bad —  
and experience three distinct endings depending on how you play.

🧩 Game Rules

You control a basket at the bottom of the screen.  
Emojis fall continuously from the top — each one represents a kind of “emotion” you can catch.  

| Emoji | Meaning | Effect |
|:------:|:---------|:-------|
| 😀 😄 😊 | Positive emotion | +1 point |
| 💖 | Strong positive emotion | +3 points |
| 😡 | Negative emotion | −1 point, −1 life |
| 💣 | Critical emotion / Bomb | 💥 Explosion → instant Game Over |

- You start with 3 lives.  
- Every time you catch a positive emoji, you gain points.  
- Catching a 😡 will hurt you, and catching a 💣 ends the game instantly.  
- Each level increases falling speed and intensity.

🎮 How to Play

- Use ← / → arrow keys to move the basket smoothly left and right.  
- The basket is **fixed at the bottom edge** of the screen — no floating.  
- Gameplay flow:
  1. Click Start to begin.
  2. Emojis start falling.
  3. Catch good ones, avoid the rest.
  4. When you reach the score threshold, a message appears:
     ```
     🎉 Level Complete!  
     Press SPACE to continue
     ```
     Press Spacebar to start the next level.
- The basket moves fluidly rather than in steps for a natural motion.
- Each caught emoji fades out (gradual transparency) at the moment of contact.  
- The 💣 bomb triggers an explosion animation and an instant loss.

🔊 Audio Design

- Catch sound: soft “ding” for every successful catch.     
- Explosion sound:triggered instantly when 💣 detonates.

🎬 Demo Video

The demo video demonstrates three different endings:

1. ✅ Victory / Full Completion
   You complete all levels and survive every emotion.  
   The final screen celebrates composure — calm after chaos.

2. 💔 Failure – Lives Depleted
   You lose all lives by catching too many 😡 emojis.  
   The screen fades red and a low-tone sound plays, symbolizing burnout.

3. 💣 Failure – Bomb Explosion**  
   You catch a 💣.  
   Immediate explosion effect (💥 animation + shaking + flash), followed by instant Game Over screen.

- Basket rendered as a glowing blue shape aligned perfectly to bottom edge.  
- Fade animations for smooth visual rhythm.  
- Explosion uses screen flash + brief shake.  
- Responsive design — playable across resolutions (720p–1080p).

🧠 Concept

> “You can’t catch every emotion —  
> sometimes the best way to win is knowing what to let fall.”  

This game uses the metaphor of “catching emotions” to express how focus, balance, and over-control interact.  
The visuals, timing, and audio combine to create a meditative but challenging rhythm experience.
